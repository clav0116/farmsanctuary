                <p class="pmnbd" id="white">Factory farms dominate U.S. food production, employing abusive practices that maximize agribusiness profits at the expense of the environment, our communities, animal welfare, and even our health.</p>

<!-- Introduction  -->
<div>
<h1 class="pmnblk htop" id="dg">INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p class="pmnreg ptop">
    Far from the idyllic, spacious pastures that are shown in advertisements for meat, milk, and eggs, factory farms typically consist of large numbers of animals being raised in extreme confinement. Animals on factory farms are regarded as commodities to be exploited for profit. They undergo painful mutilations and are bred to grow unnaturally fast and large for the purpose of maximizing meat, egg, and milk production for the food industry. Their bodies cannot support this growth, which results in debilitating and painful conditions and deformities.
</p>

<p class="pmnreg ptop">
    The factory farming industry puts incredible strain on our natural resources. The extreme amount of waste created by raising so many animals in one place pollutes our land, air, and water. Residents of rural communities surrounding factory farms report high incidents of illness, and their property values are often lowered by their proximity to industrial farms. To counteract the health challenges presented by overcrowded, stressful, unsanitary living conditions, antibiotics are used extensively on factory farms, which can create drug-resistant bacteria and put human health at risk.

    <p class="pmnreg ptop">
            Chickens used for egg production are among the most abused of all farm animals. From hatching to slaughter, egg-laying hens are subjected to mutilation, confinement, and deprivation of the ability to live their lives as the active, social beings they are.
    </p>

    <p class="pmnbd highlightl" id="dg">
            To meet the consumer demand for eggs, 280 million hens laid 77.3 billion eggs in 2007
    </p>

    <p class="pmnbd highlightr" id="brown">
            Because male chicks have little value to the egg industry, 260 million are killed each year upon hatching
    </p>

    <p class="pmnbd highlightl" id="dg">
            95% of egg-laying hens spend their lives in battery cages

                The life of a breeding sow in the U.S. pork industry is one of extreme confinement, stress, and suffering. These naturally curious and intelligent animals are first impregnated at 7 months of age and live out their lives in a cycle of pregnancy, birth, and nursing until they are eventually sent to slaughter.
        </p>
    
        <p class="pmnbd highlightl" id="dg">
                At only 17-20 days old, piglets are taken away from their mothers and undergo a series of mutilations
        </p>
    
        <p class="pmnbd highlightr" id="brown">
                The piglets spend the next 6 months confined to pens until they reach “market weight” and then are trucked to slaughter
        </p>
    
        <p class="pmnbd highlightl" id="dg">
                In 2011, there were more than 5.8 million pigs used for breeding in the United States

                Cows used by the dairy industry are intensively confined, continually impregnated, and bred for high milk production with little concern for their well-being. Far from being the “happy cows” the industry makes them out to be, these typically playful, nurturing animals endure immense suffering on factory farms.

        <p class="pmnbd highlightl" id="dg">
                More than 9.3 million cows were used to produce milk in the United States
